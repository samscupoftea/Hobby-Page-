            <h3> Why Meditate? </h3>
            <p> The two most common reasons people come to find meditation are 1. A genuine curiosity into the inner working of conciousness 
                and our minds. And 2. As a solution to deep, mental suffering. I'd really love to say mine was the latter, and it that from the beginning is was pure esoteric knowledge pursuit that was guiding me. But that would be a lie. 
                My guiding star was very much rooted in the latter. Having said that, as I delved deeper into my practice over time, I actually did become more curious about the "hows" and "whys" too. 
                Back in 2015, I suddenly found myself going through some things. And, like most people in a bit of a crisis, I found myself helpless grasping for anything that might help lift me out of the despair. Then I discovered the app "headspace", decided to commit to it's 30 day course and that was that. 
                At the time I was also leaving the UK alone for Cambodia to study my TESOL with an american company and then teach english in Thailand. My plan was pretty wafer thin. But I needed a sense of adventure again, and to see something other than our little corner of it. The shifting and sometimes disorentating nature of flying to a new country alone causeed me to cling even tighter to the few objects and rituals I had brought along. Headspeace being one of them. 
                My daily morning practice helped to steady my mind each day in the chaos of change and quite severe culture shock. </p>

    <h3> Virpassana Meditation </h3>
    <p?>
        Virpassana is the most commonly practiced type of meditation and the one that most casual practioners will be somewhat familiar with. 
        My first contact with meditation was through an app called Headspace, in which virpassana is the central mode of practice. 
        Virpassana practice is usually performed eyes closed, and has one focusing (or at least trying to) on a fixed point (usually the breath). 
        Naturally the mind soon wanders and you become lost in thought, at which point it is your job to recognise this and refocus on the breath. 
        The goal is surprisingly *NOT* to repress thought or make some sort of heroic attempt to purge yourself of thinking. In fact, the practice does it's magic 
        via the repeated moments of being lost and bringing attention back to the point of focus. Eventually, the meditator begins to see thoughts as the chaotic, randomness that they are. 
        Devoid of authorship and thus devoid of any real weight. The seeing of this over and over again is what then leads to less anxious thoughts and a reduced identification with them. 
        The lessening of negative mental states is both achieved through logical deduction (the seeing of abritrary thought) but also by almost habit. 
        I would liken it to that of a muscle being trained over a period of time in the gym. The repeated acitivies over time just very naturally lead to a concrete alteration, just as in the mind.

    <h3> Dzogchen Meditation </h3>
    <p>
    Dzogchen is bit more tricky to describe and to fully grasp. Put it tis way: I have been meditating since 2016 and it was only during 2022 that the penny FINALLY dropped for me. 
     It tends to be considered as a deeper form of practice than that of Virpassana. 
    Instead of focusing on your breath or another anchor point, Dzogchen actually asks you to do away with that and instead attempt to see the non-dual nature of conciousness. 
    Non-dual nature of conciousness, you might ask. Non-dual just means not seperated, or that there isn't two of something. 
    In virpassana, we are usually practicing from the point of view of a locus of attention that is focusing on the breath and seeing thoughts and feeling whizz by. 
    And analogy used in headspace to demoonstrate virpassana would be that the concious part of the mind is standing on the side of the road looking out,
    and the traffic are your thoughts, feelings, emotions etc. Dzogchen is a lot more radical than this. It says no, no, no. There isn't a you looking out a road at all. 
    There is "Just" whatever is appearing right now, in the momment.
