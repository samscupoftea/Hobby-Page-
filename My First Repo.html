    <h3> Virpassana Meditation </h3>
    <p?>
        Virpassana is the most commonly practiced type of meditation and the one that most casual practioners will be somewhat familiar with. 
        My first contact with meditation was through an app called Headspace, in which virpassana is the central mode of practice. 
        Virpassana practice is usually performed eyes closed, and has one focusing (or at least trying to) on a fixed point (usually the breath). 
        Naturally the mind soon wanders and you become lost in thought, at which point it is your job to recognise this and refocus on the breath. 
        The goal is surprisingly *NOT* to repress thought or make some sort of heroic attempt to purge yourself of thinking. In fact, the practice does it's magic 
        via the repeated moments of being lost and bringing attention back to the point of focus. Eventually, the meditator begins to see thoughts as the chaotic, randomness that they are. 
        Devoid of authorship and thus devoid of any real weight. The seeing of this over and over again is what then leads to less anxious thoughts and a reduced identification with them. 
        The lessening of negative mental states is both achieved through logical deduction (the seeing of abritrary thought) but also by almost habit. 
        I would liken it to that of a muscle being trained over a period of time in the gym. The repeated acitivies over time just very naturally lead to a concrete alteration, just as in the mind.
