# My-First-Repo

With this being the first project, I trying to take my time to ensure I actually understand the process of
each little addition. There is a temptation to simply copy great swaths of code. But that would just lead me knowehere.

Before starting work on the projects, there was some work to be done in getting acquainted with Visual Code, Git and GitHub. I figured I should make sure these three processes were working well before going any further.

Linking Github with Git and Visual Code took some time. But this was essential in order to ensure that my code and my "commits" could document everything as I made progress through my projects.

Upon downloading some helpful extentions for Visual Code, I found a particularly useful one.
It was called 'Project Manager' and allows you to add multiple folders into one place in VISUAL CODE. This meant that I could then jump between projects at the click of a button, but they still remained seperate entities.

I began very simply by focusing only on the HTML document page first. Adding, my basic heading and paragraphs. I then downloaded some desired images and managed to link and display them also.

Now that I had some basic content, it was time to move on to some stylings using CSS.
The biggest challenge I found was learning how to link the CSS page successfully to my HTML page. This issue persisted for days before I realized on the first coding meetup on January 31st that I was simply missing a ".

Wed 8th Feb:
Today I tried to learn and then implement <div> tags in a useful way.
One of the biggest breakthroughs today was learning how to create a class for each <div>. This has allowed me not only to organize my webpage. But also style specific aspects of the page and sections in bulk. Before today I was slightly confused about this aspect and this opened up more possibilites.

In addition, I added some a function list that will include the names of useful meditation apps and websites.
I also taught learnt how to turn an image I have on page into a link. This makes my page far more seemless and a lot more interactive for the user.

Thursday 9th Feb:

Today I focused upon learning and using <article> and <section> tags, to help better organise my hobby page.
I also added the <nav> tag to what will soon become the nav bar at the top of the page.
I need to learn how to format the webpage to give it some style but also because I want the page to have a logical design language that includes side-by-side columns for each of my three aspects of meditation.
I implemented what I had learnt yesterday by using the <div>=class tag to create classes for each of my article sections so that they can then
easily be styled and adjusted in CSS.
Finally (this took me FOREVER to figure out) I got my downloaded background image to display as the backdrop for me page.
I had multiple attempts at trying to make this work. I ran into problems such as the link to the local image not working, all the way to the div tag not responding. What worked in the end was to create a <div= class> for the image in HTML, and then link the image in CSS with the within BODY. Somehow that seemed to work. Tomorrow I will more thoroughly look into exactly why the "body." assignment in CSS was neccessary.

Friday 10th Feb:
Today I am looking to do establish my column layout for my hobby page. I have one quite inefficient way of doing it and am currently in the
process of seeing how I can write more efficient code. For example, one that utlises the <Div> in a much simpler way.
I have found on W3's website an example so I am going to try and make amendments next to see how it works out.
