# My-First-Repo

With this being the first project, I trying to take my time to ensure I actually understand the process of
each little addition. There is a temptation to simply copy great swaths of code. But that would just lead me knowehere.

Before starting work on the projects, there was some work to be done in getting acquainted with Visual Code, Git and GitHub. I figured I should make sure these three processes were working well before going any further.

Linking Github with Git and Visual Code took some time. But this was essential in order to ensure that my code and my "commits" could document everything as I made progress through my projects.

Upon downloading some helpful extentions for Visual Code, I found a particularly useful one.
It was called 'Project Manager' and allows you to add multiple folders into one place in VISUAL CODE. This meant that I could then jump between projects at the click of a button, but they still remained seperate entities.

I began very simply by focusing only on the HTML document page first. Adding, my basic heading and paragraphs. I then downloaded some desired images and managed to link and display them also.

Now that I had some basic content, it was time to move on to some stylings using CSS.
The biggest challenge I found was learning how to link the CSS page successfully to my HTML page. This issue persisted for days before I realized on the first coding meetup on January 31st that I was simply missing a ".

Wed 8th Feb:
Today I tried to learn and then implement <div> tags in a useful way.
One of the biggest breakthroughs today was learning how to create a class for each <div>. This has allowed me not only to organize my webpage. But also style specific aspects of the page and sections in bulk. Before today I was slightly confused about this aspect and this opened up more possibilites.

In addition, I added some a function list that will include the names of useful meditation apps and websites.
I also taught learnt how to turn an image I have on page into a link. This makes my page far more seemless and a lot more interactive for the user.
